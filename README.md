What the project does:
->This a simple but unique website to know the word count of user's article/essays etc. 

Why the project is useful:
->It can sometimes get tiring to write essays but what's more tiring is counting the number of words to check if we exceeded the word limit,
this is where Countbot can help.

Where users can get help with your project
->Knowing the word count of a text can be important. For example, if an author has to write a minimum or maximum amount of words for an article, essay, report, story, book, paper, you name it. Countbot will help to make sure its word count reaches a specific requirement or stays within a certain limit
